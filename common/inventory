# Inventory used to do things like wipe file signatures from partititions
# and disks (mostly) to reset portions of the infrastructure without having
# to redeploy the VMs. Simplifies having to change the MAC addresses in
# /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf until I review and modify existing work on automation.
